# TurnBasedEngine
2d Turn based engine in unity

This project aims to implement an extendable Turn Based system in Unity. The aim is to implement an observer pattern Event Manager which can then be used to
send Turn change events to any subscribed objects. Event system can also be used to add UI callbacks and whatever the developer desires. 

Additional utilities might include 2d grid based collision checking (either Raycasting or storing and checking blocked spaces with movement) and A* 
pathfinding.
